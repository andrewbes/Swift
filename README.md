# Swift
RepoList is an application for viewing the list of repositories on GitHub and comments marked with //TODO:. The application can also be used as a template for building an app with MVVM+C+Services architecture. It includes a separate networking layer (RequestkManager, request classes, and response models) that interacts with Alamofire. The program is written in Swift using UIKit and uses async/await for handling asynchronous calls.
